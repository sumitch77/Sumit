  <!-- Sohrai Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Sohrai Art</h2>
      <p>
        Sohrai painting is a traditional mural art practiced by tribal communities in Jharkhand, especially the Santhal and Munda tribes. These paintings are created during the Sohrai festival, which celebrates cattle and harvest. The walls of mud houses are coated with white earth and decorated using natural pigments derived from red ochre, black manganese, and yellow clay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artists use chewed twigs, fingers, and combs to draw motifs of animals, plants, and geometric patterns. The art is deeply symbolic, representing fertility, prosperity, and harmony with nature. Passed down through generations, Sohrai is more than decoration—it’s a spiritual offering and a cultural identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Women are the primary custodians of this art form. They gather in groups, singing folk songs as they paint, turning the act into a communal celebration. The designs often include elephants, peacocks, fish, and flowers, each carrying symbolic meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, Sohrai has gained recognition beyond village walls. Artists have begun painting on canvas, paper, and textiles, bringing tribal aesthetics to urban markets. NGOs and cultural organizations are helping preserve and promote this heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The earthy tones and raw textures of Sohrai art evoke a sense of rootedness. It’s not just visual—it’s emotional, spiritual, and ecological. Every brushstroke is a prayer, every pattern a story.

  <!-- Khovar Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Khovar Art</h2>
      <p>
        Khovar painting is a ceremonial art form associated with marriage rituals among tribal communities in Jharkhand. The word “Khovar” comes from “Kho” (cave) and “Var” (bridegroom), symbolizing the bridal chamber. These paintings are created by women on the inner walls of homes during wedding season.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Sohrai, Khovar uses a combing technique. Artists apply black and white clay layers and scrape patterns using combs, fingers, or sticks. The result is a striking monochrome design featuring motifs like peacocks, fish, trees, and abstract symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        Khovar art is deeply ritualistic. It’s believed to bless the couple with fertility, harmony, and protection. The act of painting is meditative, often accompanied by chants and songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, Khovar was confined to mud walls, but modern artists have adapted it to paper, cloth, and even murals in public spaces. The art has found admirers in galleries and exhibitions across India and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bold contrasts and intricate patterns of Khovar reflect the strength and creativity of tribal women. It’s a visual language of love, commitment, and cultural pride.

  <!-- Dhokra Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Dhokra Art</h2>
      <p>
        Dhokra is an ancient metal casting technique practiced by tribal artisans in Jharkhand and neighboring states. Using the lost-wax method, artists create intricate brass figurines, jewelry, and ritual objects. The process involves crafting a clay core, covering it with wax, and then encasing it in another clay layer. When heated, the wax melts away, leaving a mold for molten metal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dhokra art is known for its rustic charm and symbolic motifs. Common themes include tribal deities, animals, dancers, and scenes from daily life. Each piece is handmade, making it unique and full of character.
      </p>
      <p>
        The art form dates back over 4,000 years, with roots in the Indus Valley Civilization. Despite its age, Dhokra remains relevant, blending tradition with contemporary aesthetics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artisans often work in family units, passing down skills through generations. The craft is labor-intensive, requiring patience, precision, and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Dhokra items are popular in home décor, fashion, and gifting. They represent sustainability, as the materials used are eco-friendly and locally sourced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dhokra is more than metal—it’s memory cast in bronze. It preserves tribal stories, rituals, and values in tangible form.

    <h1>Musical Instruments of Jharkhand</h1>
    <p>Explore the soul of tribal rhythms: Mandar, Nagara, and Bansuri</p>
  </header>

  <!-- Mandar Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Mandar</h2>
      <p>
        The Mandar is a traditional drum deeply embedded in the tribal music of Jharkhand. It is cylindrical, made from hollowed wood and covered with animal hide. Played with hands or sticks, the Mandar produces a deep, resonant sound that forms the backbone of many folk rhythms.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is especially prominent in Santhali and Ho tribal dances, where its beats guide the choreography. The Mandar is not just an instrument—it’s a symbol of celebration, community, and spiritual connection. During festivals like Sarhul and Karma, the Mandar echoes through villages, calling people to gather and dance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The making of a Mandar is a craft in itself. Artisans select specific types of wood, often from mango or jackfruit trees, and stretch leather across the ends. The tension and thickness of the hide determine the pitch and tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        In performance, the Mandar is often accompanied by singing and other percussion instruments. Its rhythmic patterns are passed down orally, with players learning through observation and practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mandar’s role in rituals is profound. It is played during harvest prayers, weddings, and even funerals. Its sound is believed to ward off evil and invite blessings.

  <!-- Nagara Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Nagara</h2>
      <p>
        The Nagara is a large kettle drum played with sticks, known for its thunderous sound. It is used in ceremonial and festive contexts across Jharkhand, especially during processions and tribal dances. The Nagara’s booming tone sets the mood for grandeur and excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, the Nagara is played in pairs—one drum for bass and the other for treble. The player uses curved sticks to strike the leather surface, creating dynamic rhythms that energize the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
        The drum is made from metal or clay, with goat or buffalo skin stretched across the top. The body is often decorated with tribal motifs and painted in bright colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In tribal festivals, the Nagara leads the musical ensemble. It signals the start of rituals, dances, and storytelling performances. Its sound is considered sacred and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nagara is also used in temple ceremonies and folk theater. Its dramatic sound enhances the emotional intensity of performances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning to play the Nagara involves mastering rhythm cycles and understanding the cultural context. It is often taught within families, preserving musical heritage across generations.

  <!-- Bansuri Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Bansuri</h2>
      <p>
        The Bansuri is a bamboo flute cherished in Jharkhand’s tribal music. Its soft, melodic tones evoke nature, emotion, and spirituality. Played horizontally, the Bansuri has six to eight finger holes and is tuned to various scales.
      </p>
      <p>
        In tribal culture, the Bansuri is associated with love and longing. It is often played solo or as part of folk ensembles. Its sound complements the earthy rhythms of drums and the lyrical flow of tribal songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flute is made from locally sourced bamboo, selected for its resonance and durability. Artisans carefully bore holes and polish the surface to ensure clarity of sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bansuri is used in dances like Santhali and Mundari, where its tunes guide the movements and emotions of performers. It is also played during harvest celebrations and moonlit gatherings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning the Bansuri requires breath control, finger dexterity, and a deep sense of melody. Tribal musicians often improvise, creating tunes inspired by birdsong, wind, and river flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bansuri’s simplicity hides its expressive power. It can convey joy, sorrow, devotion, and nostalgia—all through a single breath.
